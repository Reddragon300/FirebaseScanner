In your code, a log file is created in the "logs" directory with the name "firebase_scanner.log." This log file is used to store log messages generated by your program during its execution. These log messages contain information about the program's activities, such as when it finds Firebase instances, when it encounters errors, and when it completes its scanning process.

Here's the relevant code that configures the logging system and creates the log file:

python
Copy code
# Configure the logging system
log_format: str = "%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s]: %(message)s"
log_dir = "logs"
if not os.path.exists(log_dir):
    os.makedirs(log_dir)
log_file = os.path.join(log_dir, "firebase_scanner.log")
logging.basicConfig(filename=log_file,
                    level=logging.INFO, format=log_format)
The logging.basicConfig function sets up the logging system to write log messages to the specified log file. The log messages are formatted with a timestamp, log level, and message content, making it easier to track and debug the program's behavior.

As your program runs, it uses the logging module to write log messages to this log file, which can be helpful for debugging and monitoring the execution of the Firebase Scanner. You can check this log file to review the program's activities and identify any issues that may arise during its operation.
